# Chile-Harvard-Project
These files show part of the final result of Chile-Harvard one-week project. We have done the following things.
1. Build a database with influxdb
2. Estimate the redshift coefficients and therefore derotate the galaxy
3. Match the templates with the spectra of the galaxy in order to estimate the correponding properties of every pixel, including age, metalicity, and so on.
